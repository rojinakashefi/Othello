# Othello

Othello is a strategy board game played between 2 players. One player plays black and the other white.

### Setup

The board will start with 2 black discs and 2 white discs at the centre of the board.

They are arranged with black forming a North-East to South-West direction.

White is forming a North-West to South-East direction.

### Game Play

Then the game alternates between white and black until:

- one player can not make a valid move to outflank the opponent.

- both players have no valid moves.

  When a player has no valid moves, he pass his turn and the opponent continues.

  A player can not voluntarily forfeit his turn.

  ------

  1. A move is made by placing a disc of the player's color on the board in a position that "out-flanks" one or more of the opponent's discs.

  2. A disc or row of discs is outflanked when it is surrounded ***at the ends*** by discs of the opposite color.

  3. A disc may outflank any number of discs in one or more rows in any direction (horizontal, vertical, diagonal).

     for example:

     by putting white piece in (x=6,y=4),the black piece in(x=5,y=4)must change in white color(horizontal change):

### End of the game

When it is no longer possible for either player to move, the game is over.

The discs are now counted and the player with the majority of his or her color discs on the board is the winner.

A tie is possible.
